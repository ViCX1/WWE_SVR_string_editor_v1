# WWE SVR String files edior (psp/ps2/ps3/xbox/wii/pc)
Allows to edit strings. Converts the string database files from the game to plain text that can be easily edited with a text editor such as notepad.
Logo and icon values are not implemented yet so editing the lines that contain non-ASCII values is only possible manually (via hex). 
The only logo that is editable at the moment is the WWE logo which will be displayed as *wwelogo* in the text file and it will be replaced with its original value in the file.
